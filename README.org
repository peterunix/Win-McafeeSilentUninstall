* Details
Silently uninstalls all McAfee products using McAfee's [[https://download.mcafee.com/molbin/iss-loc/SupportTools/MCPR/MCPR.exe][MCPR Tool]].
I ran the MCPR tool and made a copy of the files it extracted in $env:temp.
I had to google this, but I found a source online that showed the command line flags you can use to silently uninstall everything.
The mistake I made was not making a note of the original source.
It wasn't very hard at all to find on google.

* Usage
#+begin_src shell
# This will take a while to finish running
./script.ps1
#+end_src
